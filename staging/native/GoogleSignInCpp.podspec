Google Sign-In is a secure authentication system that reduces the burden of login for your users, by enabling them to sign in with their Google accountâ€”the same account they already use with Gmail, Play, Google+, and other Google services.
This C++ SDK wraps the iOS SDK, as well as the android SDK, providing a platform agnostic API.
